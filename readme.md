# Screenplay

A modified version of Paperthin. A Twine story format designed to look like a screenplay. Uses tags to show a specific run-through of the script to help actors during capture sessions.

See an example in `example.pdf`.

To add this story format to Twine add the url `https://github.com/joebain/screenplay/releases/download/0.1/format.js`.
